# The-most-robust-binary-search

Recently, when working with data series information, I needed to find the corresponding data and used the dichotomous lookup method. In the use of the While loop has been caught in the difficult to adjust the reference, so in-depth dichotomous find the principle of the following rules.
## Examples
As a simple example, let an array be {1,2,3,4,4,4,7,8}.
One needs to find the requirements.
-  1縲：ind the first ">=4" element.
-  2縲：ind the last "<4" element.
-  3縲：ind the first ">4" element.
-  4縲：ind the last "<=4" element.
